# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Random forest classifeir
The main aim of the project is for the prediction of heart disease based on 14 attributes like age, sex, resting blood pressure, etc. In the preprocessing stage, the distribution of each attribute is studied and understood the relationship between each other using the Seaborn library. Based on the understanding of the data distribution, a custom-made Random Forest classifier had trained and used to classify the testing dataset. The Parameters of the Random Forest classifier had selected using the GridSearchCV Using the chosen parameters 
random-forest had produced a classification accuracy of 91.8%.
